# voice-gender
Often, the human ear can easily determine a personâ€™s gender as male or female
voice within the first few spoken words. However, designing a computer program
to do this may be more complicated.
This repository describes the design of a computer program to model the acoustic
analysis of voices and speech for determining gender. The model is constructed
using 3,168 recorded samples of male and female voices that processed using
acoustic analysis and then applied to an artificial intelligence algorithm to learn
gender-specific traits.
